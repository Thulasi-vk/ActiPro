Description: This package takes standard Actigraph data, as either CSV or AGD files, and outputs activity data. 
    It can also merge this data to ecological momentary assessment windows to produce time-linked windows for data analysis.
    Lastly, it is able to produce novel accelerometer data based on findings from Keadle et. al. originally generated with 
    Activpal accelerometers.
    Note: This software contains some code designed to interface with data produced by the University of Southern 
    California Real-time Eating, Activity, and Children's Health (REACH), such as the reach_adapter function.
